# Ping and Pong

This application is a small proof of concept for a Workspace component that can house child components which use a shared workspace state. Clicking Ping will disable Ping and enable Pong, clicking Pong will disable Pong and enable Ping. The Workspace can be copied with its implementation and so render two or more Workspaces with separate state spaces.
